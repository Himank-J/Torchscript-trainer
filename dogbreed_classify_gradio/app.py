    ## Identify Your Dog's Breed!
    Upload a clear photo of a dog, and I'll tell you its breed and share an interesting fact about it! 
    This model can identify 10 popular dog breeds with high accuracy.
    
    ### Supported Breeds:
    Beagle, Boxer, Bulldog, Dachshund, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Poodle, Rottweiler, Yorkshire Terrier
    """,
    article="""
    ### Tips for best results:
    - Use clear, well-lit photos
    - Ensure the dog's face is visible
    - Avoid blurry or dark images
